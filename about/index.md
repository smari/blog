I am Smári McCarthy &#8211; software developer, writer, hacker, freedom fighter. A jack of many trades. I [travel][1] a lot, I do a lot of 
[talks][2], I [write][3] a lot. I use [Twitter][4] and [Facebook][5] (reluctantly). I live and die by e-mail. There are other ways to [contact me][6]. 
Somebody wrote a [Wikipedia page][7] about me.

## Work

I work on [Mailpile][18] and [some other things][19]. I used to be the executive director of [IMMI][20], but now I'm
a board member there instead.

I work on everything from information security and free software development to infrastructure assessments, general technical consulting, 
information policy planning, political consulting, and whatever.

## Some interests
Societal cybernetics, self-organization, control systems, statistics, digital freedoms (free software, free hardware, free culture, 
free spectrum), digital fabrication, industrialization & industrial policy, international law.
